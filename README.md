This my NPX card unique style to connect with me directly via console or terminal

## üëá just hit

If you have Node.js installed:

```bash
npx ebdonato
```

Or a Docker alternative:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --name ebdonato-business-card -v ${PWD}:/usr/src/app -w /usr/src/app node:14 npx ebdonato
```

And get to know me in some kind of an unique style.

## Thanks [Anmol Pratap Singh (anmol098)](https://github.com/anmol098)

_anmol098_ spent a non-trivial amount of effort building and designing his iteration of [npx card](https://github.com/anmol098/npx_card), and he is proud of it! All he asks of you all is to put a **star** ‚≠ê on this [project](https://github.com/anmol098/npx_card) and not claim this effort as your own ‚ô•.

**I forked npx business card my from his**
